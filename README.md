#Building an AI chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a fantastic way to blend creativity with logic. Using libraries like spaCy, NLTK, or even regex-based intent matching, you can create bots that respond to greetings, jokes, philosophical questions, and more. Your ChitBot project is a great exampleâ€”rule-based, modular, and engaging. Copilot can help you structure intents, refine regex patterns, and suggest fallback responses. ChatGPT is perfect for brainstorming quirky replies, philosophical one-liners, or even riddles to make your bot more human-like. W3Schools offers foundational Python syntax, while YouTube tutorials can guide you through building chatbots with machine learning enhancements like intent classification using scikit-learn.
